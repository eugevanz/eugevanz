- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @eugevanz

You are now looking at a repository I put together over the years. It contains JavaScript work and Python scripts, the latter being less featured than the former.
With some projects the twain intertwine. You'll quickly come to realise the focus is around creating simple solutions that rely on an internet hosted user interface,
and server executably code. Storage should be used as infrequently as possible.
